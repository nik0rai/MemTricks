# MemTricks

The stack allocator is the natural evolution from the arena allocator. The approach with the stack allocator is to manage memory in a stack-like fashion following the LIFO principle. Therefore, like a stack of books, if you put something on the top of the stack earlier, you need to pick that book up first before you get one underneath.
